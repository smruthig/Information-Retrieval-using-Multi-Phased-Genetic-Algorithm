# Information-Retrieval-using-Multi-Phased-Genetic-Algorithm

This project aims to enhance query weight optimizations in search engines using genetic algorithm.  

There are 3 stages involved:  
1. Create a tf-idf vectorizer.
2. Preprocess the query, use the vectorizer on the query and every document, and find the cosine similarities.  
3. Use genetic algorithm to find the best search results while adding a bit of diversity.
